# CAN-TestBed

The CAN-TestBed is a hands-on tool designed to teach car network security. It connects real hardware to a web dashboard, effectively creating a "virtual car" on your desk. 

This tool allows students and researchers to replay authentic CAN traffic logs (`candump`), configure hardware-level ID filtering, and perform real-time security assessments by simulating attacks like ID spoofing and Denial of Service (DoS) in a safe, controlled environment.
